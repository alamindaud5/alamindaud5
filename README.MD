BUSINESS AND MARKETING

We are seeking funding of $10,000 to start an online startup. Our idea is to create a platform that connects freelancers with clients, providing a streamlined and efficient way for them to collaborate on projects. With the growth of the gig economy, there is a need for a platform that brings together freelancers from various fields and connects them with clients looking for their services. Our platform will not only provide a space for freelancers to market their skills but also offer tools for project management and communication.
